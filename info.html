        Sally Rooney grew up in the west of Ireland. She studied English
        literature and later earned a master's degree in American literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her debut novel gained critical acclaim, and by her late twenties, she
        was dubbed "the first great millennial author.
      </p>
      "

      <p>
        She is known for her quiet, introspective style and her exploration of
        communication, emotional intimacy, and class dynamics in modern life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rooney's writing often focuses on the internal lives of her characters,
        depicting the complexity of human relationships with striking realism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rooney has been compared to authors like Jane Austen and J.D. Salinger,
        but her voice is distinctly modern, capturing the psychological
        landscape of young people navigating love, power, and politics. Her work
        is celebrated for its emotional intelligence, sparse prose, and cultural
        relevance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite her fame, Rooney is known for her privacy and thoughtful
        critique of fame and capitalism—topics that she sometimes weaves into
        her fiction. She has also voiced political views, especially regarding
        social justice and the role of art in society.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2024, she released a new short story titled <em>Intermezzo</em>,
        further fueling speculation about a possible fourth novel. Readers and
        critics alike continue to follow her work with great anticipation.
